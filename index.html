                    During the COVID pandemic, usage of food delivery apps like Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub has skyrocketed as people are stuck at home, or at least are now used to ordering in. During this time—especially at the start of the pandemic—many users raised important ethical questions: is it right for me to be using these apps, putting delivery drivers at risk, when I’m trying to avoid getting sick?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The fact is, these apps have long been ethically questionable—long before the pandemic, all the way back since their conception. <mark class="mark-rounded mark-rose">Why are these apps so fundematically problematic? Let’s take a deep dive into that question.</mark> 
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="py-40 px-20 bg-gradient-to-b from-black via-zinc-600 to-background">

                <h1 class="text-3xl text-white font-bold"> 
                    PART ONE
                </h1>
    
                <p class="text-2xl text-white">
                    the beginning
                </p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="py-40 px-20 bg-background text-zinc-800 text-2xl font-medium">

                <p class="pb-10">
                    Food delivery apps—and other gig economy apps like Uber and Lyft—are currently trying their best to dodge government legislation like California’s Assembly Bill (AB) 5, which would require them to legally classify their workers as employees rather than independent contractors. (The difference between the two classifications lies in labor and wage policies; for instance, most employers in California need to pay employees for overtime work and provide health insurance). 
                </p>

                <p class="pb-10">
                    The apps are instead lobbying for legislation like Proposition (Prop) 22, which sought to exempt them from AB 5 by granting an exception for app-based drivers. After pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into a public campaign to urge Californians to vote in favor of Prop 22, it passed in 2020 with 59% of the vote, although it’s now mired in intense legal battles over its constitutionality. 
                </p>

                <p class="pb-10">
                    One of the central tenets of the apps’ argument for policies like Prop 22 is that they are just neutral third parties who simply facilitate connections between drivers, restaurants, and customers. Uber Eats’ website advertises delivery driving jobs to workers with the enticing promise of “being your own boss.” However, this claim is far from reality—in truth, these apps are just another example of a technology with inherent politics; a human-created artifact that establishes a power structure between stakeholders who interact with it. Drivers are in fact not their own bosses—the apps’ algorithms are, as they determine everything from drivers’ work options to their pay rate.  
                </p>

                <p class="pb-10">
                    But why are gig economy companies lobbying so hard for these policies in the first place? Why are these apps so desperate to push their narrative and avoid classifying their workers as employees rather than independent contractors?
                </p>

                <p class="pb-10">
                    The short answer: it’s because they’re actually unprofitable, and their business model is unsustainable. Apps like Uber Eats and Doordash have, in their entire existence, never been annually profitable. Never. Their usual profit margin for each order is so low that they’re just being subsidized by venture capital. With investors still hopeful about the promise of growth, companies are desperately competing with each other to establish market dominance and start at least breaking even. To stay afloat, they’re relying on passing the costs of expansion and user acquisition to drivers and restaurants.  
                </p>

                <p class="pb-10">
                    This brings us to the big question: <mark class="mark-rounded mark-yellow">should these apps even exist? Is it ethical for these companies to continue trying to grow an unprofitable, unsustainable model that relies on drivers and restaurants shouldering the burdens?</mark> Let’s take a look at what those burdens are.
